In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

It will start a server at port 3000. When the server is up, a form window opens in the database in your default browser. You can also open it via the link http://localhost:3000/

Fill the form and click submit. An alert of form submission is shown. The filled form credentials appears below.
